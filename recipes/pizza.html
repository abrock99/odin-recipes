    <img src="./img/Fig-and-Goat-Cheese-Pizza-1.jpg"></img>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3><ul>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1/3 cup warm water (not hot!)</li>
    <li> 1 tsp sugar, honey or agave will also work well</li>
    <li> 1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
    <li> 1 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus more for brushing onto crust</li>
    <li> 1 medium onion, sliced</li>
    <li> 1/4 cup water</li>
    <li> 1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li> 1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li> 1 cup fresh figs, sliced into sixths</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup fresh arugula</li>
    <li> 3 oz goat cheese</li>
    <li> Salt</li>
    <li> Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li> Corn meal</li>
    </ul>
   <ol> <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>To make dough: Combine water, sugar and yeast in a small bowl. Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. This will activate the yeast-- it should look foamy. If it doesn't, your yeast may be expired... go get some fresh yeast!</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and kosher salt. Add the yeast mixture along with the olive oil and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface. Knead the dough for 5 minutes and shape into a ball.</li>
    <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, you are ready to assemble and bake the pizza. Preheat oven to 450 degrees and place a pizza stone or sheet pan into the oven to allow it to come to temperature as well. (A pizza stone is recommended; they are a great investment if you're planning to make a lot of pizza, because they help the crust bake evenly and crisply).
        Punch down the dough ball down flat and place on a floured surface. To roll out, start in the middle and roll towards the edges, giving a quarter turn with each back-and-forth motion. Add more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Roll out to roughly 13‚Äù across.</li>
    <li>To slice figs, first remove stems, then cut in half. Cut each half into thirds. Then sprinkle the caramelized onions, sliced figs, and goat cheese across the top of the pizza. Be sure to sprinkle the toppings evenly.</li>
    <li>Carefully transfer the assembled pizza to your preheated pizza stone or sheet pan. Bake for 10-12 minutes or desired doneness.</li>
