    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li> 2 tbsp baking powder</li>

   <ol> <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>Position rack in the middle of oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the top of a muffin pan with non-stick coating, and line with paper liners.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 1/4 cups sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Mix together 1 3/4 cup of the flour and baking powder.
